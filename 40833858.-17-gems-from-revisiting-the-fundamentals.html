Every single one of the huge apps that make it to the top of the charts are at least partly pushed by paid acquisition.&nbsp;<em>Example: TikTok</em>. You need a combination of a lot of paid acquisition, a lot of virality and a great product to stay at the top for long.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/162">02:42</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #2</strong></p><p>You should&nbsp;<strong>start working on organics way before your app is live</strong>: building an email list, content, community, etc.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/360">06:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #3</strong></p><p>You need to&nbsp;<strong>fuel your cohorts so you can work on improving retention</strong>. You want a minimum of new users every day so you can know if the latest release you ship is better than the previous one. If you don’t have a strong organic foundation, then paid UA is probably required.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/410">06:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #4</strong></p><p><strong>Be careful about the biases that your early adopters can bring</strong>&nbsp;(if you have a strong organic baseline) because their behavior is not necessarily representative of the mainstream audience. This can make running paid UA healthy: to prove your hypotheses and optimize the product towards the mainstream audience.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/437">07:17</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #5</strong></p><p>You might want to exclude the cohorts for days where you get App Store features (if it represents a big portion of your audience), because the audience is often on the opposite end of early adopters and not representative of what your product should become.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/577">09:37</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #6</strong></p><p>If you have a very&nbsp;<strong>small budget</strong>&nbsp;(like $500/month),&nbsp;<strong>focus on organic or specific paid actions</strong><em>(e.g., promotion on Reddit, very specific keywords on ASA, etc.)</em>. Do not go to Facebook or Google, because they are machine-learning driven.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/795">13:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #7</strong></p><p><strong>Building your owned and earned audiences is a must</strong>&nbsp;from Day 1 and all the way (even after you start paid UA). You need to find the ways that work for you to do that.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/975">16:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #8</strong></p><p>The only real lasting thing you get from App Store features is the “Editor’s Choice” badge that you can keep permanently on your listing.<br>(Jacob, Revenue Cat)</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/1115">18:35</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #9</strong></p><p><strong>The core of the UA manager job today is producing, testing and deploying creatives</strong>. The role is also more strategic, as you have to think more like a data analyst so you can feed the right events to the machine learning algorithms.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/1815">30:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #10</strong></p><p>Marketers look a lot at the impression to install ratio, but&nbsp;<strong>Facebook is now taking engagement more into account</strong>&nbsp;(“like” vs. “comment” or “shares”, view rates, etc.) You need to trigger these positive signals through your creatives and keep people engaged on the Facebook platform for the algorithm to favor you in the auction.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/2418">40:18</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #11</strong></p><p>Be careful about using “free” in your communications: start a free trial, etc. because you might attract users that just want free stuff. It’s probably best to have less users coming in but more qualified.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/2768">46:08</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #12</strong></p><p>Facebook’s algorithm wasn’t looking only at the data from your app, it was&nbsp;<strong>also looking at the data from&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>pretty</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;much all the apps in your category</strong>. With ATT, the duopoly is now attacked at the heart of their differential advantage.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/3390">56:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #13</strong></p><p>With the new attribution system&nbsp;<strong>it’s going to be even trickier to optimize for the free trial event</strong>. Smart subscription advertisers often&nbsp;<strong>use a more complex event than the free trial</strong>, by layering it with some other things that are specific to their app.&nbsp;<em>Example: free trials for users that have not cancelled within the first 2 hours + engagement.</em></p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/3555">59:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong> 💎  #14</strong></p><p>Subscription apps with no free trials that don’t have the budgets to optimize for purchases have to&nbsp;<strong>find earlier signals to create a “bundle of events”</strong>: onboarding answers, accepting notification requests, etc.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/3660">1:01:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #15</strong></p><p><strong>Customizing too much</strong>&nbsp;the combination of events you’re optimizing for on Facebook can also&nbsp;<strong>prevent its algorithm from optimizing correctly,</strong>&nbsp;because the comparison with the data that it has from all the other apps becomes less relevant.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/3741">1:02:21</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #16</strong></p><p>There is no single source of truth anymore.&nbsp;<strong>What the ad networks do to optimize and the way advertisers interpret it is going to be more complex</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Example: Google might use a blend of signals (SKAdNetwork, the IDFA when available, Android app, first-party data around contextual placements and other apps, etc.)and advertisers are going to need to use different data sets to interpret what’s happening (SKAdNetwork – not the full picture, IDFA, media-mix model or probabilistic model, known behaviors from specific-channels – like how fast users go through onboarding).</em></p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/3960">1:06:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #17</strong></p><p><strong>Try to better understand the interdependencies between</strong>&nbsp;channels (e.g., email list, Instagram, offline, etc.) so you can assess how much you should be putting back into the paid acquisition machine.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/q4v0EwBojdy/4524">1:15:24</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
