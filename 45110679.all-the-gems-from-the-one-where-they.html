<p>Hi there, <br><br>Today’s gems are mined from a podcast where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-smart-9b149646/">Adam Smart</a> (Director of Product at AppsFlyer) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-mishra-4333a340/">Piyush Mishra</a> (Lead Growth Marketing at Product Madness) talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwright1987/">John Wright</a> (Head Of Operations at Luna Labs - an ironSource Company) about the importance of creatives in a world full of automation and algorithms. They take a look at everything from the basics, to playable ads, to a whole new world of analytics that is now spawning from them as a result.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png" width="549" height="230" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:230,&quot;width&quot;:549,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3149,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce34a5cb-15a0-4048-8ba7-77509ebd2dfe_549x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>💎<strong> #1</strong></p><p>Static ads are still a big part of the advertising industry: <strong>almost 60% of the spend goes to static ads</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/GuJ31RECN4r/202">03:22</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#2</strong></p><p>You need to have a <strong>diverse creative strategy: playables, videos and static ads</strong>.
