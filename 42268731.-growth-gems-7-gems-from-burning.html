<p>Hi there,<br><br>Today's gems are mined from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY6gy-BJSvI">a webinar put together by AppFollow</a> with AppTweak, App Radar, Mobile Action, and The Tool:</p><p></p><h2>Burning ASO Questions</h2><p><br><strong>💎#1</strong><br><br>When getting started first find the right keywords, then start tackling the conversion rate so you can get meaningful results. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=247">04:07</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>You have to prepare your description using Google Natural language and optimize for both Google's robots and people. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=464">07:44</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>You need to repeat keywords in your Google Play Store long description but the recommendation is to have a density of 2-3%. You should not go over 3% (which would be keyword stuffing). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=605">10:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br>Important to have the end user in mind. You want to nail especially the beginning of the description (first two paragraphs) and include important keywords there for Google. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=772">12:52</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>We need to be careful about what we call low volume keyword vs. high volume keywords because the relation between the keywords' popularity score is exponential. If you choose a keyword that has too much popularity, you probably won't rank. Keywords with a popularity of 10/20/30 are "also fine". <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1034">17:14</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>You can pay to rank on a specific keyword with ASA and by doing so you can figure out if it is a good fit for relevancy: keywords that drive traffic but also convert. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1265">21:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>When Apple's algorithm sees that a paid keyword is driving downloads to an app, it decides that it is indeed a relevant keyword and that the app should rank higher. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1310">21:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>Premium games: video really important because you need to convince to pay and it is hard to do with just screenshots. There is no way around it. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1504">25:04</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>Ilia from AppFollow has almost 99% confidence that Google reads screenshots. Example: an app got bunked because it had a keyword in a screenshot that Google judged inappropriate. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1880">31:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>Screenshot creation: you can integrate <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a> within your app to take screenshots while testing your app, and you can also localize what you see in the screenshots. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=1996">33:16</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#11</strong><br><br>Screenshot upload: you might have around 1,000 screenshots to upload if you handle localization. AppRadar let you just upload a folder with all your screenshots, AppRadar detects the language and uploads to App Store Connect and Google Play. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=2030">33:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#12</strong><br><br>For indies when doing keyword research start by targeting lower volume, long tail keywords (2-3 words). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=2338">38:58</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#13</strong><br><br>Team up with influencers and micro-influencers to get the initial boost organically. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=2450">40:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#14</strong><br><br>You can also optimize your iOS In App Purchase fields <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=2692">44:52</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#15</strong><br><br>Best practice from APAC region: running pre-order Apple Search Ads campaign so that you have a good boost as soon as the app launches (lots of downloads in 1 or 2 days). Recommended especially for games. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=2781">46:21</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#16</strong><br><br>Changing the category (without ASO or app update) and ending up in a category where your app becomes better than your peers can have a significant impact. ⚠️ But be careful! <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=3083">51:23</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#17</strong><br><br>Ideal keyword update frequency: Apple: iterate every 3/4 weeks but once you find your set of keywords, keep it (maybe seasonal change, big competitor change, etc.). Google: iterate keywords every 6/8 weeks when in testing mode but after that, keep it (only seasonal changes, etc.). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/qY6gy-BJSvI?t=3467">57:47</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
