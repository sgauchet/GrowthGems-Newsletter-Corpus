But go further and&nbsp;<strong>segment users so you can implement an ad frequency that is optimized for each segment</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/270">04:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #5</strong></p><p>For new users, start at a high price point but already adding a bonus or a discount. If players don’t purchase, keep the value constant but reduce the price over time&nbsp;<em>(e.g. $5 -&gt; $3 -&gt; $1)</em>. If they still don’t purchase, start increasing the value with a bigger discount or bonus.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/365">06:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #6</strong></p><p><strong>It costs money to bring players in</strong>, and when you have a freemium model with no ads then&nbsp;<strong>anything you can get out of players is good</strong>. Value can come from virality (<em>e.g. players share something</em>), but sometimes even getting a small amount with a big discount is better than nothing.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/546">09:06</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #7</strong></p><p><strong>It’s very powerful to not let your players play for too long</strong>: if you have mechanics that limit how long they can play, it makes players come back.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/988">16:28</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #8</strong></p><p>When forming monetization hypotheses to test for, consider what competition is doing but also&nbsp;<strong>what features are being added in adjacent genres and categories</strong>. MobilityWare has found a lot of success that way.&nbsp;<em>Example: social casino with women &gt; 40yo playing collections, clubs, leagues, etc. (a lot coming from Asian games).</em>&nbsp;Features can be simplified for your game if that audience is a good fit.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/1240">20:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #9</strong></p><p><strong>It’s important to have a threshold you want to reach for your target KPI when testing</strong>&nbsp;the first version of a feature/MVP, especially if you know iterations will be needed. A feature might not move the needle on monetization right away, but if engagement improves significantly it shows there is potential because players care about it.&nbsp;<em>Example: comparing two features with one increasing engagement 2% and the other 40%.</em></p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/1385">23:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #10</strong></p><p>Companies that monetize through ads don’t really tap into adding monetization hooks into their LiveOps, and sometimes skip LiveOps altogether. But&nbsp;<strong>you can always incorporate monetization across the flow</strong>&nbsp;with things like “double your rewards by watching an ad”.</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/1780">29:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #11</strong></p><p>To come up with good LiveOps, think about the user segment you’re trying to optimize for. Are you going after the average players? Or your most engaged/valuable players?</p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/1992">33:12</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #12</strong></p><p>Approach your roadmap with an open mind, and willing to actually change your mind.&nbsp;<em>Example: initially pushing for a feature internally or to management but deciding not to do it anymore after thinking more about it and looking at more data.</em></p><p><a href="https://lnns.co/BNTMKJnuw2r/2329">38:49</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
