<p>Hi there,<br><br>Today's gems are mined from <a href="https://www.mobilegrowthassociation.com/podcasts/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-app-and-great-tools-that-help">a podcast episode of the Mobile Growth Podcast where Peggy Salz interviews Simon Lejeune</a> (Head of UA at Hopper):</p><p></p><h2>Smart strategies to keep users hooked to your app</h2><p><br><strong>💎#1</strong><br><br>When you have a <strong>long sales cycle</strong> like it's the case for Hopper, it's important to have a couple of <strong>early metrics</strong> to tell if your users are qualified so you can shift your budget the right way. At Hopper it is the "watch" rate. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=6:50">06:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>Hopper uses a fixed payback period of 12 months. They <strong>look back on cohorts</strong> and measure the average revenue per new user install during these 12 months in order <strong>to define a CPI target/limit</strong>. They then spend as much as possible within that limit. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=7:30">07:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>Some things can work well from an initial engagement perspective but backfire on internet or social media. Example at Hopper: when they tried "fake Hawaii flight notifications" (backslash on Reddit). <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=13:10">13:10</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br>Additional <strong>smaller channels can become a distraction</strong>: tracking, talking to reps, etc. Hopper now focuses on the biggest channels (FB/Instagram, Google UAC) and their efforts and energy there. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=21:38">21:38</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>Hopper still leverages Pinterest/Twitter/Snapchat that all together bring an interesting amount of volume. It allows to <strong>diversify/spread when seasonality happens</strong> (to avoid peaks) and <strong>gives some leverage</strong> with the different channels (even the big guys). <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=22:00">22:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>For the automation of all their "flight deals" ads the (really technical) marketing team created "Hopper Ads Engine" where they can "fetch the top 500 flight deals for existing customers and generate creatives, campaigns and ad sets for X Y Z channel". The data and these creatives are then sent to the networks directly or to <a href="http://smartly.io">Smartly.io</a> which generates the creatives (even dynamic video ads). <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=24:45">24:45</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7<br></strong><br>With <a href="http://smartly.io">Smartly.io</a> Hopper can generate thousands of videos with just a few clicks that have a very high relevance because of the targeting and deals. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=26:42">26:42</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>Try to understand <strong>where Facebook and Google are going</strong> and <strong>do work in the opposite direction:</strong> try to build on what they are lacking. Because FB/Google take over the optimization part of the business, Hopper focused on creatives instead of an optimization engine. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=27:38">27:38</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>Hopper tries to <strong>build tools that reallocate budget between channels</strong>, not necessarily within a channel. Because FB/Google are never going to do that, it is another thing that is valuable for the long term. <br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mobilegrowthpodcast/smart-strategies-to-keep-users-hooked-on-your-appand-great-tools-that-help#t=28:44">28:44</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
