One reason might be that Google was already probabilistic in nature.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1390">23:10</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #11</strong></p><p>Unity is a clear winner of the last couple of months.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1417">23:37</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #12</strong></p><p>Both&nbsp;<strong>ironSource and Unity have been using the term “contextual targeting”</strong>&nbsp;and feel like they’re well positioned to take advantage of that. Both are bullish on the stability of their network, and where they’re headed.&nbsp;<em>Unity captures and analyzes 50 billion in-app events per day.</em></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1448">24:08</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #13</strong></p><p>Upptic sees that on iOS, for certain apps,&nbsp;<strong>SDK Networks have started to represent a bigger proportion of the profitable spend than FB/Google</strong>. However a possible reason is that major networks are&nbsp;<strong>still relying on probabilistic attribution through MMPs</strong>, and this might not be a short-sighted approach.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1529">25:29</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #14</strong></p><p>Consumer Acquisition is seeing a 15-20% ROAS loss overall, but with some categories much more impacted (e.g. apps whale hunting vs. match-3 games).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1609">26:49</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #15</strong></p><p>If you’re a network and you’ve lost your ability to deliver high-value users, you’re going to put more lower-quality traffic into the mix.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1686">28:06</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #16</strong></p><p>Good UA has a halo effect, especially for large titles. So when Upptic is still working off old prediction models for an app and UA is not as good, they’re also seeing organics trend down.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1745">29:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #17</strong></p><p>Any team is going to have to&nbsp;<strong>get into the game of prediction</strong>, whether they’re comfortable with it or not.

It won’t target the individual and will be substantially less efficient.

This will allow you to&nbsp;<strong>cluster creative and interest</strong>.&nbsp;<em>Example of campaigns: targeting people that like to kill each other vs. people that like to relax vs. people that like to complete levels.</em></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=3220">53:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #29</strong></p><p><strong>Winners</strong>: large companies with large first-party data reservoirs, midcore games with broad monetization profiting from other games not able to target whales, IP games.&nbsp;<strong>Losers</strong>: companies spending less than a million a month on advertising, companies primarily relying on ad monetization, companies that don’t have the cash flow to roll-out an 18-month LTV window and sustain it.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=3450">57:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p>And before I leave, a friendly advice for UA managers:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Now you MUST be friend with the product team</strong></em> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Matej Lancaric</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p><p></p>
