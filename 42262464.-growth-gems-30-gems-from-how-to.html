leading to a web onboarding flow</strong> can still be worth it: it can <strong>allow you to broaden the audience beyond the reach of app install campaigns</strong> (some networks don't target LAT people, some people don't click on app install ads and end up seeing less of them). <br><br>08:40</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #2</strong><br><br><strong>Once people download an app you can get a great completion rate</strong> even with a longer in-app onboarding, but this might be more challenging to do on the web.<br><br>09:09</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #3</strong><br><br>With a web onboarding you only pay 3% to Stripe instead of 30% to the app store but <strong>the added friction might bring your conversion rate down 27%</strong>, making things even. <br><br>09:34</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #4</strong><br><br><strong>The real benefit of a web onboarding flow is that people become your direct customers</strong>. It is a massive benefit to have that direct relationship, as it brings flexibility when it comes to cancellations, refunds, renewals, etc. <br><br>10:09</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #5</strong><br><br>Having a direct relationship with the customer allows you to do things like <strong>partial refunds</strong>: instead of cancelling a yearly subscription directly for the customer, you can offer them to refund half of the subscription while keeping their access on. It's a win-win. <br><br>10:52</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #6</strong><br><br>With the IDFA deprecation coming up, a lot of people are trying to move to web. But it's a different mindset and <strong>very few people have the skills to understand the app store ecosystem AND the web ecosystem</strong> at the same time. <br><br>17:05</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #7</strong><br><br>You are losing a lot of users at that App Store page step. You can't control it, and you think you could do better with landing pages. But still <strong>the bounce rate can be higher on the web</strong>! <br><br>18:08</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #8</strong><br><br>A lot of people try to increase just one metric and think it could trickle down all the way. But <strong>early drop-offs (like on the App Store page) can filter out low-intent people</strong> that would never convert anyway. <br><br>19:16</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #9</strong><br><br>The growth hacking mindset when it comes to funnels is not the right one. <strong>You can endlessly A/B test an onboarding flow yet still have your conversion rate go down</strong>, or fail to increase revenue. <br><br>20:22</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #10</strong><br><br>You can not just focus on A/B testing specific parts of the funnel because these <strong>local optimizations often disregard the impact on down-funnel metrics</strong>. Another <strong>critical aspect is the traffic composition</strong>. <br><br>21:10</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #11</strong><br><br>Even if you consider both deeper-funnel events and traffic composition, be careful about over optimizing for revenue. <strong>Short term gains can end up being long term losses and prevent you from really scaling</strong>. <em>Example: great payback period but high churn.</em> <br><br>27:12</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #12</strong><br><br><strong>Put secondary metrics ("tradeoff metrics") to every test you're doing</strong>. It's more complex but leads you to think bigger picture. <em>Example: retention when optimizing for revenue, email sales when adding SSO, etc.</em> <br><br>28:12</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #13</strong><br><br>Eric has seen some games where <strong>subscription players (often high LTV ones) end up up paying more on in-app purchases after subscribing</strong>. Players get a subscription to be more competitive, but as more players subscribe as well they still need to buy IAPs. <br><br>29:30</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #14</strong><br><br>A lot of games are not doing subscriptions because they have <strong>already found a way to get their players to spend as much as possible</strong>. <br><br>30:47</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #15</strong><br><br>The beauty of the <strong>subscription mode</strong>l is the predictability/security but a major flaw is that you have a <strong>high floor and a low ceiling</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>High floor: high barrier to entry because some people would pay for a daily/weekly pass but not a subscription so you're leaving money on the table.</p></li><li><p>Low ceiling: nothing more to "extract" from a user that has already paid. </p><p>31:27</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #16</strong><br><br>You can even <strong>sell non digital goods to your subscribed users</strong>. This is what the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sweat-kayla-itsines-fitness/id1049234587">Sweat app</a> is doing with a shop. The community wants branded goods. <em>Another example with 8fit: super expensive subscription where they could deliver fruits &amp; vegetables through Instacart</em>. <br><br>33:33</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #17</strong><br><br>Think about how you can fight against the "low-ceiling" of your subscriptions. <strong>What can you upsell</strong> (another product, another subscription, a bundle with another app through a partnership, etc.)? Subscriptions don't have to be a binary thing. <br><br>35:34</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #18</strong><br><br>What's the probability that the price you set for your subscription is the max they're willing to spend? <strong>If you're already willing to buy the subscription, you'd probably be willing to pay more</strong>. <br><br>37:00</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #19</strong><br><br>If you're an app like Calm or Tinder, a +2% gain is huge and small price optimizations end up being worth doing (especially because you have the data to do it). <br><br>38:09</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #20</strong><br><br>The problem is that <strong>people over experiment but don't test radical enough things</strong>. The less data you have and the more you haven't been down the road of experimentation, the more radical you should be. <br><br>39:23</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #21</strong><br><br>If you find <strong>5-10% increments in monetization</strong>, it might make a <strong>huge difference in the volume you can unlock through UA</strong> (passing a bid threshold can unlock acquisition volume). <em>Example: an app that had already iterated on its paywall finds +15-17% increase in revenue that unlocked massive volume.</em> <br><br>40:52</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #22</strong><br><br>Think about the <strong>state of mind in which the user is</strong> when he reaches the paywall. Don't think about cosmetic changes (bullet points, buttons, etc.). <em>Example:</em> <em>show 30% discount if they skip the paywall, then if they skip again then email with 50% discount, etc. But you can go even further: daily pass when they hit the paywall the second time, free month if they invite somebody when they hit the paywall for the third time, etc.</em> <br><br>41:55</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #23</strong><br><br>The best experiments are the ones that work on the <strong>onboarding screens before the paywall</strong>. <em>Anecdote: an app Thomas works with had tested having a longer loading screen ("preparing your plan"), which increased intent because it hinted at personalization (even though there was none).</em> <br><br>42:57</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #24</strong><br><br>If you <strong>make the skip button more obvious</strong> on your paywall (instead of making it discreet) you churn people less, you get less dissatisfied people and you get an opportunity to monetize them another way. <br><br>44:50</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #25</strong><br><br>Instead of trying to optimize the subscription bundle at the highest price possible right out of the gate:</p><ul><li><p>Prove out that initial payers are ready to pay for a subscription</p></li><li><p>Collect more data</p></li><li><p>Upsell other things they could find value in and purchase (digital goods, different kinds of content, etc.) <br><br>47:35</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #26</strong><br><br>Always raise your price: <strong>the highest price always wins</strong>. Only a small percentage of people are willing to pay for in-app subscription, and those people are not really price sensitive. <em>Example: speechify at $150, tests Thomas did with first $50 vs. $100, etc.</em> <br><br>52:06</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #27</strong><br><br>Price elasticity is typically very low, but don't push the fact that conversion doesn't change that much when you increase prices. It might be best to <strong>leave some money on the table</strong> (more users who pay less) if it means that you <strong>get more data, your community grows</strong>, etc. <br><br>54:02</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #28</strong><br><br>There are beneficial effects of having a bigger userbase: word of mouth, viral effect, etc. but <strong>customer churn also becomes less meaningful</strong>. <br><br>54:40</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎 #29</strong><br><br>In crowded spaces, people are not going to compare the apps' content that much (short term). But the <strong>power of brand is what comes in when you reach a degree of maturity</strong>, with often 1 or 2 players. <em>Example: Peloton, Headspace, Calm. True in language learning too.</em> <br><br>01:01:50</p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
