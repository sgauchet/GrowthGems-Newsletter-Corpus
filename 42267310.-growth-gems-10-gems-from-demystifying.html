<p>Hi there,<br><br>Today's gems are mined from another <a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM">presentation made during the App Promotion Summit by&nbsp;Marie-Laure Cruyt</a> (Chief Product Officer at AppTweak):</p><p></p><h2>Demystifying ASO On Google Play</h2><p><br><br><strong>💎#1</strong><br><br>On the Google Play Store, AppTweak recommends a keyword density between 1% and 2%. 3% keyword density is already high and anything above that can be considered keyword stuffing by Google. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=369">06:09</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>You want to look deeper into top 10 ranking progression and not just at the app visibility because if the app starts ranking better on high-volume keywords, it has a huge impact on visibility. But if it starts ranking better on low volume keywords, the impact is not as strong. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=450">07:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>Because you can't have density on an infinite number of keywords you want to focus on the keywords that are the best for your app:</p><ul><li><p>Select the most relevant</p></li><li><p>Avoid keywords that are too competitive <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=846">14:06</a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br>Emojis can make a difference in conversion and you can incorporate them in your app title and/or your short description. Because you can not A/B test your app title you want to do sequential tests where you go back several times to the original emoji-less title to compare results. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=1337">22:17</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>Out of 10 US apps that A/B tested video in 2020, 5/10 chose to keep the version with the video. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=1552">25:52</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>For your description, base your decision on keyword density but regarding length you need to keep the user in mind. So write what you want to say, then tweak it to have the right keyword density on important keywords. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=2268">37:48</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>Retention has a huge impact on ranking in Google. Overall retention is taken into account for both keyword and category rank and Google also measures the retention at a keyword level to influence rankings. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=2662">44:22</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>When you select your keywords look in your search terms in the Google Play developer console and make sure to keep those with a high retention. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=2704">45:04</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>Google tags have a direct effect on the similar apps shown and influence both:</p><ul><li><p>The apps that point towards your app</p></li><li><p>The apps that your app points towards to <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/7Fspko-retM?t=2964">49:24</a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p><p><br><br></p>
