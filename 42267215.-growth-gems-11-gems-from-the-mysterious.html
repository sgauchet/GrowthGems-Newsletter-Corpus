<p>Hi there,<br><br>Today's gems are mined from <a href="http://mobileuseracquisitionshow.com/episode/the-mysterious-lat-and-how-to-tame-it-with-thomas-petitgrowth-consultant/">a podcast episode on The Mobile User Acquisition Show (RocketShipHQ) with Thomas Petit</a>:</p><p></p><h2>The mysterious LAT, and how to tame it – with Thomas Petit</h2><p><br><strong>💎#1</strong><br><br><strong>Facebook</strong> has decided to <strong>never show mobile app ads to LAT users</strong>. Because the LAT cohort is about 20-30% in the ecosystem, a huge amount of your potential audience is never going to see your Facebook app install ads. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=661">11:01</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>Since you can't reach that LAT cohort with app campaigns you might want to <strong>run web campaigns</strong> towards a landing page and then to your app. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=735">12:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>You can also target these LAT users on the web, either directly (if you "hack your way" - not always reliable) or through landing pages</p><ul><li><p>"Web" Google Ads</p></li><li><p>Outbrain/Taboola <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=825">13:45</a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br>Geo is a big factor. The US is one of the market where the range is the highest: average rate was 30% last quarter. You can go to your MMP/Analytics to check the rate: if you're way below this then you are not reaching a big part of your audience. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=960">16:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>On Apple Search Ads, Apple self-categorizes as LAT anyone that is under 18 even if LAT is not activated on the device. There are no ads at all for users under 13. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1128">18:48</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>LAT tends to increase on iOS but on Android the LAT rate has gone down and is around 2-3%. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1220">20:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>If your rate of LAT is extremely low and it's not related to your vertical, there are probably some actions that could allow you to spend less than on Facebook (for example). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1358">22:38</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>The <strong>LAT ON</strong> cohort is <strong>a third cheaper to acquire on Apple Search Ads</strong> (even cheaper for games) so it would be a shame to miss out on it. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1521">25:21</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>Target both group on Apple Search Ads: LAT OFF only and then everybody (→ multiply your ad groups by 2). Have a bid for the LAT OFF (more trackable, more expensive) and have another bid level for the other group. Use extrapolations to manage your bids. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1598">26:38</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>An extra benefit of having "All users" ad groups that include LAT ON is that it is not only LAT ON users: you're also getting a bunch of LAT OFF users for cheaper than you would have otherwise and it lowers your TOFU prices. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1640">27:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#11</strong><br><br>Even apply this duplication of ad groups (creating an "All users" ad group, not just LAT OFF) to new users and returning users groups. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1705">28:25</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#12</strong><br><br>You really only need 3 ad groups per keyword(s) group:</p><ol><li><p>New users LAT OFF</p></li><li><p>Returning users LAT OFF</p></li><li><p>Open group: "All users" (LAT ON) ad group which include both new users and returning users <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=1705">29:10</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#13</strong><br><br>Start splitting your organic between "organic LAT OFF" and "organic LAT ON" in your internal system so you understand each cohort's behavior. You can measure the behavior of thee cohorts against organic and Search Ads. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=2090">34:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#14</strong><br><br>Compare the 3 cohorts (Search Ads LAT OFF, Organic LAT OFF, Organic LAT ON) in terms of onboarding, conversions, retention, LTV, etc. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=2130">35:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#15</strong><br><br>Compare the size of these cohorts. Stop targeting LAT ON for a week or two, and look how the 2 organic cohorts are evolving and use this to make extrapolations for the future. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XhJOyLlhqiI?t=2140">35:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
