<p>Hi there,</p><p>This week’s gems were mined from from "<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup">The one about DSPs</a>", "<a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a>" and "<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7116257476620/WN_6VUcGyruSyi6R6FnTPJuzA">From iOS 14.5 to iOS 15</a>".</p><p>Enjoy!<br><br><br></p><h2>Attribution</h2><p>[💎@13:15] We haven’t yet felt the full impact of iOS 14.5 because&nbsp;<strong>some attribution is still done with probabilistic attribution</strong>. But that will change as soon as Apple cracks down on it.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshi-blum-1a04ba38/">Moshi Blum</a> (VP Marketing at Beach Bum Games) / <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7116257476620/WN_6VUcGyruSyi6R6FnTPJuzA">From iOS 14.5 to iOS 15</a></em></p><p><br><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> ironSource and Unity have apparently been crushing it, and Upptic sees that on <a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1529">iOS SDK networks have started to represent a bigger proportion of the profitable spend than FB/Google</a>. A possible reason is that they are still relying on this probabilistic attribution. Is it a shortsighted approach, though?</em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@18:43] <strong>The more SKAdNetwork campaigns you have</strong> (you can have up to 100), <strong>the less likely you are to pass the privacy thresholds</strong>. AppsFlyer has seen the number of conversions especially decrease (privacy thresholds not met) when there are more than 50. But that’s something the advertiser doesn’t always have control on <em>(e.g. Facebook)</em>.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-yanai-7a9a3844/">Roy Yanai</a> (Head of Product at Appsflyer) / <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7116257476620/WN_6VUcGyruSyi6R6FnTPJuzA">From iOS 14.5 to iOS 15</a></em></p><p><br><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> there were most likely <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/inside-skan#chapter-2">privacy thresholds changes on Apple’s side around May 20th</a></em><br></p><h2><br>Paid UA</h2><p>[💎@42:00] <strong>LTV measurement has become the new advantage one advertiser can have above another</strong>.

It has prevented deals from happening. One of the first <strong>pre-screening questions is whether or not the apps use iCloud or sign-in with Apple</strong>.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moravcik/">Darius Moravcik</a> (CMO at Reflectly - Journaling app) / <a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a></em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup/919">15:19</a>] <strong>In-house DSPs can’t compete with large managed DSPs on Android</strong>, or can’t compete with Google and Facebook’s algorithm and their ability to leverage their data (including competitors’ data) to create lookalikes. However, <strong>when moving to contextual buys</strong> <em>(e.g. due to ATT)</em>, <strong>it levels up the playing field</strong> which allows in-house bidders like SocialPoint’s to compete.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrenoirotcosson/">Alexandre Noirot-Cosson</a> (Head or Marketing - Live Games at SocialPoint) / <a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup">The one about DSPs</a></em></p><h2><br>Data / Tech Stack</h2><p>[💎@<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup/220">03:40</a>] <strong>Transparency and control are why SocialPoint wanted to build a DSP in-house </strong>(besides the bidder itself):</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>: you can see which bids you were offered, which ones you successfully purchased, which ones you made an offer on but didn’t win.

If you do this enough, you’ll find UGC creatives that really work and often outperform creatives you could create yourself.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moravcik/">Darius Moravcik</a> (CMO at Reflectly - Journaling app) / <a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a></em></p><p></p><h2><br>Onboarding</h2><p>[💎@<a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA?t=1240">20:40</a>] There are two main schools of thought for onboarding:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Make it very brief and simple, then ask people to subscribe</p></li><li><p>Make it longer while making it interactive and valuable&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moravcik/">Darius Moravcik</a> (CMO at Reflectly - Journaling app) / <a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a></em></p><p><br><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> if you’re testing option 2, Fastic and Noom are doing very interesting things.
