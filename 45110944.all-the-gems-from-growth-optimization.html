<p>Hi there,</p><p>Today's gems are mined from a webinar (live presentation) where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/berlinermichael/">Michael Berliner</a> (Senior Product Manager of Growth at MasterClass) shares his high-velocity, methodical, battle-tested process which identifies and executes on business growth opportunities through product features and marketing channels. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png" width="549" height="230" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:230,&quot;width&quot;:549,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3149,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c188a5b-0612-4f14-a6ab-0e1b694f8bfb_549x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>💎 <strong>#1</strong></p><p>The theory of constraints (discussed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1EFUNH978C714&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+goal&amp;qid=1629047584&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+goal%2Caps%2C172&amp;sr=1-1">the Goal</a> book) states that if any one piece of the system is a bottleneck or a roadblock it hurts the system as a whole. And when you look at a specific piece, one can be optimized very well without impacting the throughput.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=243">04:03</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#2</strong></p><p>A lot of times companies and executive teams don’t look at how the growth metrics work together between different teams. Doing this allows you to understand what a +10% increase of a metric means in terms of revenue.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=455">07:35</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#3</strong></p><p>A lot of times, <strong>health and growth can be at odds</strong> with each other because you can trade health for more growth. Looking at the <strong>CAC/LTV</strong> ratio in combination with Revenue is healthy because it considers both. It also gives you a common reference across the whole business.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=552">09:12</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#4</strong></p><p>Masterclass uses ICE scoring (Impact Effort Confidence with a score of 1 to 5 for each) in order to rank initiatives to optimize whatever they’re working on.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=640">10:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#5</strong></p><p>The throughput funnel for a team is a function of velocity, success rate and average impact.<br>- Velocity: how many feature experiences are you putting out per engineer per week? <em>Example at Airbnb: 1 test/engineer per week.</em><br>- Success rate: for 100 experiments, how many are a statistically significant winner that you’re going to roll out? <em>A good benchmark is a 20-30% success rate which means you should expect 70-80% of your test to be flat or negative.</em><br>Average Impact: if you have a 30% success rate, what’s the average impact over these. <em>A more established company like Facebook might have a +1% average impact that drives a lot of revenue. More earlier stage companies should have a much higher average impact.</em></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1207">20:07</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#6</strong></p><p>You can drastically improve your testing velocity if you’re able to change how your team is structured and your processes. <em>MasterClass doubled their testing velocity in 1 quarter by changing processes to give more autonomy, empowering engineers to be “mini-PMs”</em>.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1357">22:37</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#7</strong></p><p>Each time engineers bring an experiment, challenge them to find one thing they could get rid off that would allow them to launch faster.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1414">23:34</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#8</strong></p><p>Think about the testing medium: how can you get the same answer differently (e.g. changing UI front-end with Optimizely) or doing something more hacky.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1427">23:47</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#9</strong></p><p>Working with a pod structure can be the most impactful change. Otherwise you might be waiting in the backlogs of other teams (e.g. design, content, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1444">24:04</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎 <strong>#10</strong></p><p>There are usually some quick wins or winning themes that will improve your testing win-rate <em>(e.g. Masterclass knows that video converts well for them and can double down on that)</em>, but the rest comes with better understanding your users over time.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/u-hyAyjUWMI?t=1485">24:45</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
