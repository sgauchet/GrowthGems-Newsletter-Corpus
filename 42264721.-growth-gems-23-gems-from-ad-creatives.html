Some channels do not have a "clean" way to <strong>A/B test</strong> <em>(e.g. TikTok)</em> but even if there is it <strong>might</strong> <strong>not give you results of what will happen "live"</strong>. <br><br>03:17:22</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>HopSkipDrive really <strong>builds creatives off of surveys</strong> they do with their customers. You can A/B test all day but you really want to first understand the value you're creating for all verticals. <em>Example for drivers: either emotionally-driven or money-motivated and they use different creatives for each bucket.</em> <br><br>03:18:00</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br><strong>Money-motivated user</strong> → more text-oriented creatives because these users don't really identify with the emotional imagery: it's more about presenting the options they have to make money. <strong>Emotionally driven</strong> → pictures showcasing some drivers to illustrate the look and feel of helping kids getting to school. <br><br>03:19:32</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>Initially JamCity was looking at traditional demographics (gender, age, etc.) but now they look more at the motivations. Mobile games are broadly appealing and the obvious motivations are boredom and wanting to relax. But there are also much deeper motivations why people play the game. They've <strong>identified much more specific segments that they are then targeting through creatives</strong> (not through targeting on Facebook) and even <strong>product</strong>. <br><br>03:21:15</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>You can start with a <strong>creative in a broad targeting</strong> to see what kind of users it brings then <strong>tweak it in that specific direction</strong>. Doing this several times you end up with a creative portfolio so that on Facebook the creatives can find their subset of users (e.g. influencer-like for younger audiences, more straightforward for older audiences). <br><br>03:22:25</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>JamCity has a fairly large consumer insights team doing <strong>quantitive and qualitative</strong> which brings a huge amount of data that they can <strong>base tests on for both creatives and product</strong>. They leverage that to improve the ads themselves but also the early retention. <br><br>03:23:57</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>JamCity has an internal team and several offices but also a <strong>huge amount of vendors</strong> (about 15) that have different specialties (UA, general marketing, production companies, high-end CG, etc.) which helps <strong>keep things diverse and creatives fresh</strong>. They try out a lot of different vendors, sometimes even outside of gaming/entertainment. <br><br>03:26:40</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>There are huge opportunities on <strong>TikTok to leverage great creators that are doing innovated things</strong>. The platform encourages finding ideas that are convincing but also "game" the algorithm. <strong>Influencer content is translatable</strong> to other platforms that have vertical video (Snapchat, Instagram) so <strong>TikTok can be a good testing ground</strong>. <br><br>03:28:59</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>For JamCity playables haven't worked out as well as everyone had hoped but <strong>HTML-interactive ads on Google UAC are really impactful</strong>. Make sure you have enough inventory for that kind of assets. <br><br>03:30:47</p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
