<p>Hi there,<br><br>The gems&nbsp;I'm sharing today are mined from <a href="https://liftoff.io/resources/webinar/the-art-and-science-of-building-a-performance-design-team/">a Liftoff webinar</a> with Noga Laron (Head of UA &amp; Growth) and Assaf Shalev (Head of Creative Marketing) from PlayStudios (casino games) and moderated by Sofia Leonova (Liftoff) and Peggy Salz (MobileGroove).&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>The Art and Science of Building A Performance Design Team</h2><p><br><strong>💎#1</strong><br><br>When measuring creative performance, first look at CTR/CVR/IPM when introducing the ad then after a few days move to Payer Rate/ROAS. <br><br>27:55</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>When you find a performing creative, try reformatting it in all possible formats. <br><br>29:25</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>Localizing voice over (narration) is not enough, and might even hurt conversion. Add subtitles for better results. <br><br>12:55</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br>When building your team, lack of ego on both the UA and design side is key. Also actually put people together in the same room (physically) and make the data (and language) accessible. <br><br>16:29</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>Understand you “know nothing” and test and learn all the time because only results count. <br><br>25:12</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>Creative creation/iteration process in brief: design team writes brief (with examples/wireframes) and creates 1st iteration, UA team tests 1st iteration, both teams discuss how to get better results and design team writes new brief and creates new version. <br><br>25:55</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>Start by producing super short and catchy creatives (4-5 second video or loop) and/or go the opposite route and create something much longer with narration or a tutorial. It is harder to find success in between. <br><br>29:38</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>To test new creatives, run a new creative test each week (with same audience/platform/geos), measure them against each other, rank them and introduce the best ones into active campaigns. <br><br>30:58</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br>Be careful of trends because if you arrive too late and everybody is doing it it might hurt you (give bad results). <br><br>32:58</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>When hiring a creative, do a home test by giving them 2 ads and attaching numbers (good/bad results info) so they can try and understand in order to give you a 3rd iteration. <br><br>36:30</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#11</strong><br><br>Generally, Liftoff sees videos showing the user experience perform better. <br><br>50:35</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#12</strong><br><br>You want everybody in your company to chime in on creatives and show ads that have convinced them to download an app/game. <br><br>57:58</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#13</strong><br><br>Measure creative fatigue by looking at how many people see the ad over time but also monitoring if the ad is reaching a new unique audience over time. <br><br>58:53</p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
