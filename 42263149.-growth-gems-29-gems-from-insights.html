You can improve ARPDAU but a few weeks into the game it goes horribly. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=322">05:22</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>You can't just run an A/B test and look at D360 ARPU. <strong>Whenever you try to improve LTV you have to take a particular lens</strong>, a proxy for your success. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=410">06:50</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>It is very different to focus on maximizing LTV for users that have not yet installed the game vs. maximizing LTV for players that have been in the game for 6 months. Older players already have a system in their heads that they are used to, but <strong>with new users you can try a lot of "weird and wonderful" things</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=490">08:10</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#4</strong><br><br><strong>WildCard Games looks at D30 ARPU growth from install as north star metric</strong>. From experience, when focusing on earlier metrics they've seen great initial impact in the short term but that didn't play out in the long run. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=516">08:36</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>The downside of having D30 ARPU growth as a north star metric is that <strong>A/B tests require many weeks and tens of thousands of users</strong>. They currently have 6 or 7 A/B tests which means they're thinking about test ideas before even getting the results, which requires <strong>a lot of patience and discipline</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=600">10:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong> <br><br>You can't run new user tests on "older" players (6+ months), but the same principles of short/long term apply: <strong>increasing ARPDAU in the short term can end up hurting you</strong>. <em>Example: if you do a great sale then you'll see great ARPDAU but there will be a hangover because players will have a lot of currency that they can't even go through fully.</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=702">11:42</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>2 ways to deal with the fact that you can't know how A/B tests will play out in the long run:</p><ol><li><p><strong>"New user" testing</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Testing things as part of an event</strong> (LiveOps). <em>Example: loyalty program where players would get a cat (in the game) with each purchase (they actually got users from the control group that wanted in).</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=740">12:20</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>You do not want to alienate your most loyal users. <strong>Week-long events help players understand that things are one-off and subject to change</strong>. You can also target specific users (non-US, a particular segment, etc.). This allows you to do multiple iteration without harming users/numbers and also makes it easier to model (build the events inside your model). <em>Example: test where you increase prices.</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=792">13:12</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br><strong>The second you add a new feature to your game, all your models and previous A/B tests are no longer totally valid</strong>. It's the same thing with your ARPU curve. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=976">16:16</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>It's really important to <strong>have the product team set clear ARPU and LTV growth goals and communicate them to the UA team</strong>. <em>Example: interstitial ad frequency test → the UA team needs to know that D1 ARPU might be great and not go 10x on spend.</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=1042">17:22</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#11</strong><br><br>LTV curve is important, modeling is important. But <strong>the underrated thing is the communication between the UA and product team</strong>. The ARPU/LTV curves are backward-looking. Since the UA sources you're scaling can bring players with different behaviors <em>(e.g. VO on Facebook vs. incentivized traffic or pre-installs)</em> your product team needs to be aware of it to build the right features <em>(e.g. focusing on whales features vs. ad features).</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=1174">19:34</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#12</strong><br><br>You can have a game that doesn't monetize at all at the core. But assuming the core is really solid then <strong>if you have world-class sales and LiveOps you can monetize very well</strong>. From there you can take bets on how to improve your games with both features and LiveOps events. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=4027">22:07</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#13</strong><br><br>Before you can even start to focus on monetization, you have to <strong>make sure you have a very tight core game loop and economy</strong>. Otherwise it's like going on Amazon and trying to sell/optimize a product for which there is no demand. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=6345">22:45</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#14</strong><br><br>During Cat Games' soft launch they 10x'ed ARPDAU. Now they are actually doing A/B tests where they are clawing back some of the features they initially added in (because the economy of the game got out of control) and seeing great improvements. <em>Example: took out global chat (it was also difficult to monitor) → early ARPDAU almost doubled and retention improved!</em> Watch to understand why. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=6772">23:52</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#15</strong><br><br>For decision-making on features, they've been using the <strong>concept of LTV vs. effort</strong>: LTV impact for days of efforts required. The same way the dev team defines how many days of efforts are necessary for a feature, the product team is responsible for creating the same thing for LTV impacts. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=6955">28:55</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#16</strong><br><br>They have <strong>exposed their north star metric of D30 ARPU growth to the team and set quarterly D30 ARPU growth goals at the game level</strong>, so the whole team is accountable. Benefits:</p><ol><li><p>It gets buy-in on chasing LTV growth</p></li><li><p>Once you get better at predicting that, the UA team can think of how much they can spend now vs. what they will be able to spend. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=3966">30:06</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#17</strong><br><br>WildCard has started to look at finding a way to <strong>anti-test whatever they plan on testing</strong>. You can get great learnings: tests can still be wins AND you're learning about your audience (and your misconceptions). <em>Example: decreasing ad load instead of increasing ad load.</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=6955">32:55</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#18</strong><br><br>Most of the features introducing a source of coins ended up being negative in the long term, and it's even worse when the feature is fun. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=5857">36:37</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#19</strong><br><br>You need to run all these tests but you need to also <strong>actually talk to your players</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=4027">39:07</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#20</strong><br><br><strong>Almost any product can learn from how games run LiveOps</strong>, the same way gaming learned from retail. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/p02g6WjZ8Gk?t=4088">44:08</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
