<p>Hi there,</p><p>This week’s featured gems were mined from <strong>"<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7116257476620/WN_6VUcGyruSyi6R6FnTPJuzA">From iOS 14.5 to iOS 15</a>"</strong>.  </p><p>The other gems from this week’s edition come from "<a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a>" and "<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup">The one about DSPs</a>".</p><p>Enjoy!<br><br></p><p></p><h2>From iOS 14.5 to iOS 15</h2><h4><strong>ATTRIBUTION, PAID UA &amp; CREATIVES</strong></h4><p><br>[💎@13:15] We haven’t yet felt the full impact of iOS 14.5 because&nbsp;<strong>some attribution is still done with probabilistic attribution</strong>. But that will change as soon as Apple cracks down on it.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshi-blum-1a04ba38/">Moshi Blum</a> (VP Marketing at Beach Bum Games)<br></em></p><p><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> ironSource and Unity have apparently been crushing it, and Upptic sees that on <a href="https://youtu.be/aaA1yYjU7Bo?t=1529">iOS SDK networks have started to represent a bigger proportion of the profitable spend than FB/Google</a>. A possible reason is that they are still relying on this probabilistic attribution. Is it a shortsighted approach, though?</em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@18:43] <strong>The more SKAdNetwork campaigns you have</strong> (you can have up to 100), <strong>the less likely you are to pass the privacy thresholds</strong>. AppsFlyer has seen the number of conversions especially decrease (privacy thresholds not met) when there are more than 50. But that’s something the advertiser doesn’t always have control on <em>(e.g. Facebook)</em>.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-yanai-7a9a3844/">Roy Yanai</a> (Head of Product at Appsflyer) </em></p><p><em><br><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> there were most likely <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/inside-skan#chapter-2">privacy thresholds changes on Apple’s side around May 20th</a></em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@28:39] Having <strong>Custom Product Pages is a huge acquisition enabler for an app catering to multiple intents</strong>. <em>Example: Wix is enabling building a website, sending email campaigns, managing chats, etc. and currently has to pack all of this in one app store listing.<br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladblaistain/">Elad Bleistein</a> (Head of Mobile Growth at Wix)</em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@42:00] <strong>LTV measurement has become the new advantage one advertiser can have above another</strong>. The better you are at measuring value, the better you can be at optimizing your campaigns.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-yanai-7a9a3844/">Roy Yanai</a> (Head of Product at Appsflyer) </em></p><div><hr></div><p>[💎@56:16] <strong>Waiting for users to be familiar with the application before showing the ATT prompt</strong>&nbsp;is a better strategy. You’ll be missing on attribution but the chances of getting a positive answer will be much higher.<br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshi-blum-1a04ba38/">Moshi Blum</a> (VP Marketing at Beach Bum Games)</em></p><p><br><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> if ads are not part of your monetization model, then you won’t have the issue of having a smaller pool of users with ATT opt-in (which I assume is a more valuable inventory). If you don’t rely on probabilistic attribution and focus on SKAN, then it seems like a no-brainer. Do you even want to show the ATT prompt in that case?</em></p><p><br></p><h2>Other gems this week</h2><h4>PAID UA, DATA, TOOLS &amp; ATTRIBUTION</h4><p><br>I’ve found all episodes of the <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/level-up-ua-appsflyer-gxyvNJXsORZ/">Level Up UA podcast</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-smart/">Adam Smart</a> (Appsflyer) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-mishra-4333a340/">Piyush Mishra</a> (Product Madness) to be full of insights.</p><p>“<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup">The one about DSPs</a>” was no exception. </p><p>DSPs (and especially in-house DSPs) is a topic I still have a lot to learn about, but it felt like this was quite in-depth!<br><br>One gem that stood out:</p><p><br>[💎@<a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup/220">03:40</a>] <strong>Transparency and control is why SocialPoint wanted to build something in-house</strong>:<br>-&nbsp;<strong>Transparency</strong>: you can see which bids you were offered, which ones you successfully purchased, which ones you made an offer on but didn’t win. You also know exactly what you buy and where you buy it: there is no black box like there can be with ad-side DSPs.<br>-&nbsp;<strong>Control</strong>: you decide what you buy and at which price you buy it. Controlling the algorithm and the decision making means you control the type of users you want to buy and for which purpose in the game.</p><p><br><em><strong>⛏️  Going Deeper:</strong> SocialPoint hasn’t built the entire DSP in-house. They use a bidder as a service technology (building a bidder in-house is apparently <a href="https://lnns.co/_eg9J7X6xup/447">a very difficult thing to do</a>), then they built their algorithm on top of that.</em></p><div><hr></div><h4>SUBSCRIPTION APPS &amp; ONBOARDING</h4><p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevepyoung/">Steve P. Young</a> has been hosting YouTube live on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AppMasters">App Masters channel</a>,  several of them with folks working with subscription apps.</p><p>I’ve often looked up to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moravcik/">Darius Mora</a> and the work he’s been doing at Reflectly. </p><p>This time, Darius shared insights about the (so far) rarely discussed topic of <a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA">Acquiring Apps as a Growth Strategy</a> and also talked at length about onboarding.</p><p>One gem that stood out (check out the source for the onboarding gems):</p><p><br>[💎@<a href="https://youtu.be/e99z7V_xiOA?t=616">10:16</a>] Transferring iOS apps can be difficult due to use of CloudKit or developers being in the Small Business Program (paying only 15% fees, not 30%). It has prevented deals from happening for Reflectly, so one of the first&nbsp;<strong>pre-screening questions is whether or not the apps use iCloud or sign-in with Apple</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><p><br>That’s it for this week.
