<p>Hi there, </p><p>Today’s gems are mined from <a href="https://tiktok.apppromotionsummit.com/talks/driving-growth-with-tiktok-marketing/">a talk at the App Promotion Summit "TikTok Marketing Strategies"</a> by <strong>Darius Mora</strong> (CMO at Reflectly) </p><h2>Driving Growth with TikTok Marketing</h2><p><br>💎#1<br><br>When running ads on TikTok, use app installs campaigns but <strong>also web conversions campaigns that send users to a landing page</strong> where a CTA then leads to download the app. The latter might often become cheaper. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=190">03:10</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#2<br><br>For targeting, <strong>use categories instead of lookalikes</strong> (not as strong on TikTok as FB/Instagram). These are view algorithm-based categories: your videos will show to people that actually watched other videos from that category. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=214">03:34</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#3<br><br>Music matters a lot, even if it's just in the background. <strong>Include music in any shape or form you can.</strong> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=299">04:59</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#4<br><br><strong>Showing the phone on the camera outperforms</strong> influencers or animations a lot of the time. It can be super simple and homemade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8W0Onp29yZc?t=397">Example here</a>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=309">05:09</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#5<br><br><strong>Focus on quantity over quality to grow organically</strong>. Post as much as you can in the day: 3 to 5 times a day. You're not alienating any followers because your video is not displayed to all your followers but initially only to a few people similar to your followers. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=455">07:35</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#6<br><br>TikTok is highly localized to the SIM card in your phone. To target a different market than where you are physically, <strong>take out your SIM card and use a VPN through wifi</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=504">08:24</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#7 <br><br><strong>Micro-influencers at scale give you better odds</strong> of getting more bang for your buck. This is because impressions are not based on number of followers and it's much more about the creative/content. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=504">11:47</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#8<br><br>If a video done through the creator marketplace works you have a chance to boost it. However make sure it's not corporate but <strong>don't "beat around the bush"</strong>: have a clear CTA and try to show the product in the video. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=740">12:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#9<br><br>Brands can't use the top trends music anymore. You can either use the music that is available or <strong>have trending music in the background</strong> (might not always be approved, and you won't get shown in the music trends). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=1196">19:56</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#10<br><br>Spending X amount of money on TikTok ads will get you automatically verified (blue check on profile). You can also create an advertising account and discuss with your TikTok rep. On the personal profile it's automated but if you're verified on Instagram or Vine you can get the verification automatically. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/hTcVMM8WOM0?t=1275">21:15</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
