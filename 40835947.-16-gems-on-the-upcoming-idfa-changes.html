<p>Hi there,<br><br>🚧&nbsp;<em>The mine is closed for the holidays. Next gems will be shared on January 12.</em><br><br>Today's gems are&nbsp;mined ⛏️ from <a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8">a SplitMetrics panel</a> with&nbsp;<strong>Andrea Raggi</strong>&nbsp;(Performance Marketing Lead at Phiture),&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Petit</strong>&nbsp;(Growth Consultant),&nbsp;<strong>Johannes von Cramon</strong>&nbsp;(Co-founder, Growfirst - Mobile Agency) and&nbsp;<strong>Ryan Goeden</strong>&nbsp;(VP of Sales at Kochava - MMP).&nbsp;  </p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Post-IDFA Changes, Strategies and Trends<br><br></strong></h2><p><strong>💎  #1</strong></p><p><strong>Start getting your legal team involved</strong>&nbsp;in the discussions because the context of this change is increased privacy. As you think about prompting for consent to share data, it's also a good time to think about consent management overall from a legislation perspective.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=554">09:14</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #2</strong></p><p><strong>Pilot some SKAdNetworks campaigns</strong>&nbsp;already: there is no reason to wait until the ATT framework is enforced before doing it. You should be able to see how things are going to look in your MMP.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=603">10:03</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #3</strong></p><p>You actually don't need to require consent (depending on your app/model). This decision on&nbsp;<strong>requesting consent or not is the starting point</strong>&nbsp;before deciding on your data infrastructure, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=745">12:25</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #4</strong></p><p>Already define which conversion values you are going to use. These conversion values are not going to be the same as the current postback you get from MMPs. You need to&nbsp;<strong>find the "magic events" you have that are indicators of good long term retention and monetization</strong>&nbsp;(run this analysis).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=900">15:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #5</strong></p><p>If you do request consent,&nbsp;<strong>start testing different UX flows</strong>&nbsp;to find the best moment (e.g. at the beginning, at a happy moment, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=1045">17:25</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #6</strong></p><p>Also ask yourself how important iOS traffic is for you. Maybe you should&nbsp;<strong>switch budget to Android, to web traffic</strong>, etc.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=1153">19:13</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #7</strong></p><p><strong>Do not underestimate the work needed to build your attribution with SKAdNetwork</strong>&nbsp;and setting up your conversion values. MMPs are building clever frameworks on top of the conversion value method that can be utilized to change these values server-side.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=1422">23:42</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #8</strong></p><p>With the ATT framework coming into effect, probabilistic attribution will become more important. There might be&nbsp;<strong>more fraud through an increase of click flooding</strong>&nbsp;to gain the attribution.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=1890">31:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #9</strong></p><p>Another potential form of fraud:&nbsp;<strong>bogus IDFAs might be created</strong>&nbsp;to inflate numbers of IDFA traffic, because that inventory will be premium.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=1960">32:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #10</strong></p><p><strong>If retargeting was important for you before, it's time to double down on lifecycle/CRM</strong>: push, liveops, etc. You retarget people when you don't manage to re-engage them with your first party channels.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=2240">37:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #11</strong></p><p>For a UA manager, optimizing is going to be much harder. But from a strategic standpoint,&nbsp;<strong>optimization is going to be done through measuring incrementality</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=2340">39:00</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #12</strong></p><p>Next year, Google and FB will strategically not be able to just show ads to only 60-70% of the inventory for app campaigns (i.e. not target IDFA-0 users).&nbsp;<strong>So if/when they start tracking users through SKAdNetwork the reach will go back to 100% of the inventory</strong>&nbsp;(i.e ads will target all users).</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=3139">52:19</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #13</strong></p><p>Apple has not communicated yet how they will track ASA. Users will see ads whether they consent or not. It looks like&nbsp;<strong>ASA won't be tracked through SKAdNetwork</strong>, and Apple might go with their own system.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=3220">53:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #14</strong></p><p>According to Kochava, Apple just released an&nbsp;<strong>API that allows them to claim attribution on users that did not opt-in through ATT</strong>&nbsp;and associate them with keywords.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=3330">55:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #15</strong></p><p>FB is not going to be more expensive on the inventory side, it's going to be cheaper. Especially if they start displaying ads to 100% of the inventory. Another factor that will decrease CPMs is that advertisers won't be willing to pay as much because high-converting users are harder to track.&nbsp;<strong>FB should get cheaper and it's an opportunity</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=3925">01:05:25</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎  #16</strong></p><p>Something you can work on if you're an advertiser is your ability to&nbsp;<strong>really know who your users are through your first-party data</strong>&nbsp;so you can go and get high-quality users for your app.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4WsgmyRkD8?t=4180">01:09:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
