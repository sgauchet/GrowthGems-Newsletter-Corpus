<p>Hi there,<br><br>Today's gems are mined from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ex6gZXK9k">a&nbsp;panel at Mobile Growth Summit SF</a> with experts from Playtika, Yousician, DraftKings, Tophatter and 8th Wall:</p><p></p><h2>Cutting Edge Of Mobile Marketing Panel</h2><p><br><strong>💎#1<br></strong><br>Tag the ids within each ad creative: not one id per creative but <strong>an id for each "element"</strong>: light/dark background, team id, player offer, CTA, etc. Add granularity of tagging for each concept so you can really understand what drives results. [DraftKings] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=980">16:20</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#2</strong><br><br>Yousician did <strong>a live op with paid content unlocked</strong> (e.g. Jimmy Hendrix songs) and people playing these songs for free for a limited time ended up converting (subscribing) at a 40-50% higher conversion rate. [Yousician] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=1594">26:34</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#3</strong><br><br>If the <strong>UA team also does retention</strong> it becomes in their own interest to make sure they get quality users in.

[DraftKings] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=449">07:29</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#5</strong><br><br>Learning an instrument is emotional and can become frustrating very quickly so they need to <strong>set the mindset with their ad creatives</strong>: ads show the journey of learning the instrument (including some hard parts and the frustration) and leverage retargeting to walk them through the journey. [Yousician] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=538">08:58</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#6</strong><br><br>It is super critical to be able to connect the dots across channels because then you can have a consistent offer across digital, TV, and <strong>pass the id(s) to the app in order to adapt the user experience</strong>. [DraftKings] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=1012">16:52</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br><strong>Naming conventions are critical</strong> because otherwise you forget which ad creative worked, or what each iteration is. [Playtika] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=1033">17:13</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#8</strong><br><br>Use audio technology in their other popular app Guitar Tuner to figure out if people have trouble with strings and they <strong>retarget that segment</strong> with Yousician so they can learn how to play. [Yousician] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=1205">20:05</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#9</strong><br><br><strong>Have a global "hold out" (control) group</strong> against which you test to measure incrementally when it comes to retargeting. [TopHatter] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/3-ex6gZXK9k?t=1230">20:30</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#10</strong><br><br>Seasonality is a big factor and it creates <strong>very different kind of lapsed users</strong> (that you want to retarget differently). Example: a lapse user coming from NFL for week 1 is very different from a user that came mid-season.
