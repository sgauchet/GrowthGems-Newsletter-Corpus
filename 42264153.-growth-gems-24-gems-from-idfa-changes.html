It will help you in the near-term (however the less IDFAs are available in the future the more your model will decline).

Both have to be synthesized in a tool for advertisers.

So the question for advertisers is: <strong>what is most important to track for you with these 6-bits?</strong> [Charles Manning, CEO at Kochava] <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/i3QjrObq45o?t=1024">17:04</a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>💎#7</strong><br><br>SKAdNetwork's timer is per event so if you have several events together (like install, conversion, completed tutorial etc.) every event resets the clock. You might end up with 20 events with a 5-hour lag between each of them yet you're not going to get a post-back bundle for all these events until 3-4 days from now. Bottomline: <strong>if you want a lot of information, it will not be as usable as it is now for campaign optimization</strong>.

Example: what happens if I turn Facebook down 40% in Germany? Do I see incremental value, a decline in revenue, or things relatively the same?

We will see a come back of private <strong>marketplaces allowing to find apps that have interesting users for you</strong>. It's going to go back to <em>"I know your game has good traffic because it has the same kind of users as my game"</em>.

Right now you can just say "we want X% ROAS". <strong>How will Facebook know how to reach that target without knowing the information?</strong> 50% of the CPM on the Facebook Audience Network is related to behavioral targeting and we need transparency on the amount of data networks will actually have after iOS14.

Finger printing will exist out of the gate but Q1/Q2 next year users that never opted in will complain they are being tracked and it will signal the end of finger printing.

However it is really difficult to target these users. How do you find the right users for your product on web?
