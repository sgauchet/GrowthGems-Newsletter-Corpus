<p>Hi there, </p><p>Today's gems are mined ⛏️ from <a href="https://mobileuseracquisitionshow.com/episode/how-idfa-changes-in-ios-14-will-impact-retention-and-engagement-strategies-with-andy-carvell-co-founder-at-phiture/">an episode of The Mobile User Acquisition Show</a> with Andy Carvell (Co-founder at Phiture):</p><h2>How IDFA Changes in iOS 14 Will Impact Retention and Engagement Strategies</h2><p><br><br>💎#1<br><br><strong>Using "scoped identifiers"</strong> from your analytics/CRM tools <strong>for internal tracking purposes will be ok</strong>. <em>Example: Amplitude uses an Amplitude id for each user, Braze id, etc.</em> You can also use a more "universal" identifier like <strong>email address, phone number</strong>, etc. if you collect that information. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=308">05:08</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#2 <br><br><strong>Regular "direct" deep linking</strong> for notifications and emails that get users to the right place in the app <strong>won't be affected</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=525">08:45</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#3<br><br><strong>Deferred deep linking</strong> when you don't know who is going to click on that link and if they have the app installed or not will be less effective. You <strong>will need to rely on a probabilistic approach</strong> to get people to the right part of the app after the install or "match" with the initial link, which might be problematic in some use cases (<a href="https://www.notion.so/RESOURCE-122-How-IDFA-Changes-in-iOS-14-Will-Impact-Retention-and-Engagement-Strategies-490bc2a8dbe741beb66b53df1101092b">examples</a>). <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=573">09:33</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#4<br><br>In general <strong>segmenting users based on behavior is not going to change</strong> because you'll be doing your segmentation in your analytics/CRM platform and using an internal id within your ecosystem. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=850">14:10</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#5<br><br><strong>Geofencing is not going to be possible</strong> without getting explicit exact location targeting permissions. <em>Example: the Burger King campaign.</em> <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=891">14:51</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#6<br><br>Challenges related to CDPs depend on your current configuration: if <strong>you're leveraging CDPs to retarget people on programmatic ad networks then you'll be highly impacted</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=1138">18:58</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#7<br><br><strong>If you have a CDP you're probably well position to adapt to the IDFA changes</strong>, as CDPs have integrations for multiple types of use cases. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=1180">19:40</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#8<br><br>It's early to say how it will impact app engagement, but <strong>iOS widgets are really cool and look a lot more usable</strong>. It's been possible on Android for a long time but iOS is doing it in a nice way. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=1349">22:29</a></p><div><hr></div><p>💎#9<br><br>Tip for IDFA consent win-back: <strong>go back to loyal users</strong> (still in the app after 2 or 3 weeks but have opted out) and <strong>ask them to reconsider</strong>. If they say yes you can <strong>deep link to the settings</strong>. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/XpfOvSWp3mY?t=1706">28:26</a></p><div><hr></div><p>Stay savvy!</p><p>⛏️ Sylvain</p>
